####MERGE###########
Merges different branches. Very useful tool to consolidate the changes from multiple branches into master

- A fast forward merge happens when the target branch is merged from the current one and there are no changes to the current since then.
 - Auto merge happens when there are changes to files in 2 branches and GIT automatically reconsiles them into one set of change.This creates a new merge to current branch
