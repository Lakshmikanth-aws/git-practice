# Practice for GIT repository creation for learning GIT
# git log - provides details of commits done
# git log --oneline --graph --all - Shows different branches along with commits happend
# git log new-branch...master --oneline - Check for commits in new-branch that are different from master 
# git log master..new-branch - Git log since the branc was created
# git log --oneline --graph --oneline - This is to display commits and merges with relationships in GIT console
# git commit -m - is for messages 
# git branch -c - creates a branch
# git branch --no-merged master - displays all the branches which arent yet merged with Master branch
# git checkout -b -- Creates a new branch and points to it
# git checkout - checkout from a branch (Updates HEAD)
# Git checkout - Checkout branch. Updates HEAD and apply changes to working directory
# Git Show <branch name> - Show a single commit
# Git diff - Shows the difference between commits
# git merge --no-commit --no-ff <branchname> - to check for changes before merger between current and deired branch
# git list - lists all branches
# git stash - Applies the changes to the current Working directory
# git stash list - Lists the stashes
# git stash pop - apply Stashed changes to WIP directory
# git remote add <remote> <url>: Add remote at <url>
# git remote -v : List remote repositories
# git push -u <remote> <branch> : Push <branch> to <remote>, and set default upstream for <branch>

Whats HEAD?
HEAD is reference to the branch that is currently active.

# A fast Fwd merge is done by GIT when there are changes to one branch but not in the current branch
# An Auto merge is done by GIT when both branches have changes but GIT is able to reconcile them automatically. Commit is done to the current branch
