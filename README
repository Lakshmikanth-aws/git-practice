# Practice for GIT repository creation for learning GIT
# GIT commit - commits
# git log - provides details of commts done
# git commit -m - is for messages 
# git branch -c - creates a branch
# git checkout -b -- Creates a new branch and points to it
# git list - lists all branches
# git checkout - checkout from a branch (Updates HEAD)
Whats HEAD?
HEAD is reference to the branch that is currently active.
git Log master..new-branch - Git log since the branc was created
git log --oneline --graph --oneline - This is to display commits and merges with relationships in GIT console
